# 🔍 miniChallengePYc-  
A collection of small programming challenges in Python and C++ designed to sharpen fundamentals.

## 📘 Overview  
This repository gathers a variety of mini-projects tackling fundamental tasks in programming — string manipulation, arrays, loops, conditionals, simple algorithms — implemented in both **Python** and **C++**.  
Each script is a self-contained challenge, ideal for demonstrating clarity, logic, and code style.

---

## 🧰 Included Challenges  
Here are some of the files in the repo, along with what they do:  
- `contador_vocales.py` — Counts the vowels in a string input.  
- `conversion-temp.py` — Converts temperatures between Celsius/Fahrenheit (or similar).  
- `diccionario-apartir-listas.py` — Builds a dictionary (map) from two lists: keys and values.  
- `generador-contraseñas.py` — Generates secure/random passwords.  
- `inver_cadenas.py` — Reverses strings or manipulates them in some defined way.  
- `ordenar-array.cpp` — (C++) Sorts an array of numbers using simple algorithm(s).  
- `ordenar-lista.py` — (Python) Sorts a list, shows algorithmic thinking in Python.  
- `palindromos.cpp` — (C++) Checks if a given string or phrase is a palindrome.  
- `piedra-papel-tijera.py` — (Python) A simple “rock-paper-scissors” game between player and computer.  
- `sumar-numero.cpp` — (C++) Adds numbers or solves a simple numeric challenge.  
- `tablamulti.py` — (Python) Generates a multiplication table up to a given number.

## ⚙️ Key Technologies  
- **Python 3.x** — for quick scripting and algorithmic thinking.  
- **C++** — for demonstrating procedural logic, efficiency and familiarity with compiled languages.  
- Clear, readable code — small scale but showing clean structure.

---

## 🎯 Why This Matters  
- Shows your ability to **switch between languages** (Python and C++) — valuable for many roles.  
- Demonstrates fundamental algorithmic skills: loops, conditionals, data structures.  
- Makes your GitHub portfolio look rich: many small projects = breadth of experience.  
- Provides concrete examples you can talk about in interviews: “Here’s how I built a password generator”, “Here’s how I sorted arrays in C++”.

## 🚀 How to Use / Run  
### For Python scripts  
```bash
python script_name.py
Replace script_name.py with any file in the repo, e.g. tablamulti.py.
```
For C++ files
```
bash
Copiar código
g++ -std=c++11 file.cpp -o output
./output
```
Replace file.cpp with the actual C++ filename, e.g. palindromos.cpp.
